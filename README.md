~~If you're looking to get paired for coffeechats you can subscribe to the coffee chat stream.~~

## Background
The original prototype began during Sheridan's batch in fall 2018. The original project can be found on glitch [here](https://glitch.com/~zulip-coffee-bot).

The current goal has now been to make Coffee Chat more robust and extenable so it can be easily maintained and additional features can be added. These goals include the following:
* decoupling the code into separate modules
* writing tests to ensure there are no regression bugs
* Using TypeScript for type safety and documentation
