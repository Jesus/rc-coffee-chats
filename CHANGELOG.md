## [2.1.0] - 2017-05-11
### Added
- ðŸš€ automated off-boarding of RC members leaving their batch, using RC API. Also, automated the onboard invitation of RC members.
- `Config` table for storing the fallbackuser email; admin users can update the fallbackuser.
- send matches as a group message
- added admin feature (notified on errors from cron, match results)
- added a `deactivate` short hand command as an alias to `update active false`.
- added a changelog ðŸ˜Ž
- added a partially working Dockerfile

### Changed
- separate cron job `.sh` files to a single entry point for cron jobs; `cron-hourly.sh` file will call the `src/crons/hourly.ts` file hourly
- CLI arguments are no longer capitalized by default in the `action-creater` parser. Needed case sensitivity when updating the fallback user's email


### Security
- validating all requests with the chat-bot user token. Fixes the security vulnerability where you could have `curl` directly to the chat bot server and changed a user's settings.
